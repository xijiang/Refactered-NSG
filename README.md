# Refactered-NSG
    My refactored NSG codes
    
## Introduction
    My codes with NSG NWS genomic selection project have reached to +4k lines.  It is time to organize them and using workflow to maintain, develop, and release these codes in a nicer manner.

## Imputation
    1. Test imputation with MD (17k) chip data on LD(8k) to MD
    2. Impute current LD data to MD level
    3. Construction of a G matrix with these data
    4. Cross-validation, 'genetic trend' test
