Usage: ./run-pipeline.sh option

options:

    bgl:  download the latest beagle.jar
    
    m17:  merge genotypes from 17k-alpha chips
    
    q17:  quality control of each 17k genotyped individual
    
    f17:  filter out ID and SNP not passed in q17.

    m8k:  merge 8k data into one file

    q8k:  quality control of 8k genotypes

    f8k:  filter out ID and SNP not passed in q17

    ilm:  imputation (filtered) 8k genotypes to (filtered) 17k genotypes

Below are to be re-organized. Don't use them now.
    g17:  construct a G matrix with 17k loci, alpha version
    lmr:  test imputation from 8k to 17k.
    6dk:  prepare the genotype data on 606k, extract 17k loci for imputation
    v34:  check v3 and v4, which is better
    8vr:  check if using 828 ID results gives better imputation
    6vr:  check if using 622 ID, i.e., NWS after 1999, is better
